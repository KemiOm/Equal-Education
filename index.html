Schools need up to date classroom and well-rounded teachers to effective educate kids. 
        Too many schools can’t provide essential resources to students because of budget cuts and lackluster funding

      <p>
Students who attend schools that don’t have proper funding don’t receive the same education as 
        their peers attending schools in wealthy neighborhoods.
        Starting at a young age low-income students are set up to not succeed and stay poor.

         Our Students

      <p>
 Members of low-income families are much less prepared for college than their higher income counterparts. Thus, they are less likely to succeed in college and drop out. 
  These college dropouts are then also less likely to find high paying jobs, and escape poverty. The cycle then continues.

      <p>
 My name is Adekemi Omoniyi. I was motivated to make this website after watching my friends around me struggle to get a good education. 
    After realizing there was many kids going through the same thing I decided it was time for a change
