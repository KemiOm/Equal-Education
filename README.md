# Starter Code File Overview
Your full activity instructions are in HQ, but here's a little cheat-sheet of the files in this project:

## ← index.html
This is your homepage. It should be the first page that you work on.

Later this week, you'll edit this file to create your checklist.

ThIS file contains the CSS rule sets for index.html and any universal elements for all pages. 
We've already included a lot of them for you, but you should customize it as you want.

## ← take-action.html

## ← take-action.css
This file contains the CSS rule set for take-action.html.
