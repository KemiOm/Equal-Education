# Starter Code File Overview
Your full activity instructions are in HQ, but here's a little cheat-sheet of the files in this project:

This is your homepage. It should be the first page that you work on.

## ← about.html
This will be your about page.

## ← script.js
Later this week, you'll edit this file to create your checklist.
